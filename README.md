# Project a Week

My brother ([@RaymoZou](https://github.com/RaymoZou)) and I are challenging each other to build a project every week. The goal is to learn and create something new, without any restrictions or limitations. The only rule is to submit something every week (around midnight on Sunday), no matter how small or simple it may seem.
