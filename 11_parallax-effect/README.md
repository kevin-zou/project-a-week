# Parallax effect
Simple project for this week since it's been quite busy. I've wanted to learn how to do a simple parallax effect and it ended up being a lot easier than expected. I added a bit of polish (the button, the code block, just stuff to make it look nice) and that'll do for week 11. Hopefully I will have more bandwidth for next week!

This implementation is pure CSS, but a cool example of what you can do with JavaScript can be found [here](https://dribbble.com/shots/5863059-CSS-mix-blend-mode-Awesome-parallax-scrolling).
