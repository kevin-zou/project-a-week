# Numbers
A number generator with some (very limited) options.

The last week has been pretty busy so it's quite a straightforward project. It was cool to play around with the native `dialog` element for the first time.

## Future improvements
- Make options dialog mobile friendly
- Add more options (eg. exclude list, only multiples of `x`)
- Add animations/visual flair
